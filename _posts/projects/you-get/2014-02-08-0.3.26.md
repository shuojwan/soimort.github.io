[You-Get](http://www.soimort.org/you-get) __0.3.26__ is now [released on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/you-get/0.3.26).

Please upgrade to the latest version:

```console
$ pip install --upgrade you-get
```

## Watch videos in your local media player

Thanks to [@radaiming](https://github.com/radaiming) for implementing this ([#286](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/pull/286)).

We watch videos all the time. Here's a new option `-p <PLAYER>` to give you the ability to stream that video from your local media player without having to download them.

* You don't need Flash plugin in your browser anymore. No more CPU overheating.
* More control options, with your favorite player (VLC, MPlayer, SMPlayer, Dragon Player)
* Get rid of all annoying ads. (Sorry Youku but 45 sec is too long!)

It works in much the same way that [youtube-viewer](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/youtube-viewer/) does. But `you-get` supports more video sites than YouTube, for sure.

Just declare your own alias for your player of choice:

```console
$ alias you-see='you-get -p cvlc'
```

Now get ready to have some fun. Watch that thing.

```console
$ you-see youtu.be/OZBWfyYtYQY
```
