[You-Get](https://github.com/soimort/you-get) __0.3dev-20121217__ is now released:

<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/you-get/0.3dev-20121217>

This release mainly fixes some major issues on downloading Google+ videos.



## #1 Downloading the highest available quality from Google+

You-Get will now download Google+ videos in their highest available quality by default.



## #2 Supporting more patterns of Google+ URLs

Google+ is [supporting custom URLs to verified people and pages](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+googleplus/posts/L2K5K1GzaSh) now, which has made more patterns of video URLs possible (Unicode, percent-encoded, original user ID). You-Get now supports all of them.

E.g.,

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4315472.js"></script>



## #3 Fixed some existing issues on Ku6, Sina and 56
