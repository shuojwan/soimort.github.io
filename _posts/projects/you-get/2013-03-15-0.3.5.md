[You-Get](https://github.com/soimort/you-get) __0.3.5__ is now released:

<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/you-get/0.3.5>

## Default to use FFmpeg for joining FLV files

_Closed Issue [#61](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/61)._

This is just a quick and dirty fix to [#61](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/61): simply default to use [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) (if one is found in the system path) for joining video segments in FLV container format, to stay clear of corrupted MPEG-4 AAC channels caused by the original concatenating algorithm.
