[You-Get](https://github.com/soimort/you-get) __0.3dev-20121219__ is now released:

<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/you-get/0.3dev-20121219>

## Supporting Tumblr

This release supports downloading videos hosted natively on [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com).

_Notes: "Tumblr videos" are those which were uploaded directly onto Tumblr. If one video is embeded and hosted on an external site, e.g., YouTube, it is not considered as a "Tumblr video". For now there is no way to download embedded videos from Tumblr URLs (anyhow you can always get their YouTube links for downloading)._

Example:

    $ you-get -i http://torustyle.tumblr.com/post/38204731233
    Video Site: Tumblr.com
    Title:      Toru Style, 岩佐美咲 - もしも私が空に住んでいたら
    Type:       MPEG-4 video (video/mp4)
    Size:       99.23 MB (104051976 Bytes)

Have fun!
