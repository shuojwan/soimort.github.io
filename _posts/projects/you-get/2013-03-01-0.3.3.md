## How to Contribute

### Report an issue

In case of any encountered problem, always check your network status first. That is, please ensure the video you want to download can be streamed properly in your web browser.

* Keep in mind that some videos on some hosting sites may have a region restriction, e.g., Youku is blocking access to some videos from IP addresses outside mainland China, and YouTube is also blocking some videos in Germany.

Please include:

* Your exact command line, like `you-get -i "www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGwy8DsUJ4M"`. A common mistake is not to escape the `&`. Putting URLs in quotes should solve this problem.

* Your full console output.

* If you executed the command and got no response, please re-run the command with `--debug`, kill the process with keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-C` and include the full console output.

* The output of `you-get --version`, or `git rev-parse HEAD` -- if you are using a Git version (but always remember to keep up-to-date!)

* The output of `python --version`.

* If possible, you may include your IP address and proxy setting information as well.

### Send me a pull request

My time for maintaining this stuff is very limited. If you really want to have support for some site that has not yet been implemented, the best way is to fix it yourself and send me a pull request.
