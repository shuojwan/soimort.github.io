[You-Get](https://github.com/soimort/you-get) __0.3dev-20121210__ is now released:

<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/you-get/0.3dev-20121210>



## #1 Downloading the highest available quality from YouTube

YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. From now on, You-Get will automatically download YouTube videos in their highest available qualities, e.g., for any video which is available in a 1080p resolution, You-Get will prefer 1080p rather than the default 360p FLV format.

You-Get will always be looking for the highest available video resolution first, then the highest available audio bitrate. Given any video available in two formats which are encoded in exactly the same resolution and bitrate, the priority sequence of codecs for You-Get will be: _WebM > MP4 > FLV > 3GP_.



## #2 Supporting SoundCloud

You-Get now supports downloading audio files (usually in MP3 format) from [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), a prevalent online audio distribution site.

You-Get even supports "not officially downloadable" audios, which you can neither download directly on the website, with _youtube-dl_ nor via any of the SoundCloud APIs. Use carefully with respect to copyrights.

    $ you-get -i https://soundcloud.com/sokovo/ann_121020_rap_02



## Future Roadmap

There will be a major code refactoring of You-Get in the future.

At this point, You-Get APIs are not stable yet, thus they are not recommended to use. You-Get APIs are planned to change immensely in the coming 0.3 release.
