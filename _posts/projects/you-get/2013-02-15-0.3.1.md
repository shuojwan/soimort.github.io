[You-Get](https://github.com/soimort/you-get) __0.3.1__ is now released:

<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/you-get/0.3.1>

## Fix issues for Google+

This release mainly fixed some issues related to Google+.
([#103](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/103),
[#104](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/104),
[#106](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/106) and
[#107](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/issues/107))

## Unit tests and Travis CI

If you are interested: You-Get is now employing the fantastic [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/soimort/you-get) for Continuous Integration. More unit test cases will be added in the future.

That means, when (unluckily) the support for a video site is broken, I will get notified of it very soon, without anyone reporting an issue.

Unit tests will be carried out on both Python __3.2__ and __3.3__, but not on any other earlier versions of Python.

Here is the current build status, which is hopefully green (nothing is broken and You-Get is scraping all video sites like magic):
