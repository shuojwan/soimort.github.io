__horseshit__ is an easy-to-use command line program that blocks websites known to distract us from our work, which is forked from [leftnode/get-shit-done](https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done).

Unlike __get-shit-done__, __horseshit__ is implemented in Python only, with both 2.x/3.x compatibility. __horseshit__ is also a PyPI package, so that it can be installed and updated via `pip` or `easy_install`.

Project homepage: <http://www.soimort.org/horseshit>

Fork me on GitHub: <https://github.com/soimort/horseshit>



## Installation

### 1. Using the PyPI package:

Install the PyPI package:

    $ pip install horseshit

or:

    $ easy_install horseshit

### 2. Using Git:

Clone the Git repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/soimort/horseshit.git

After cloning this repository, you may want to put it in your `$PATH` and ensure it is executable.



## Usage

### 1. Setting horseshits

`horseshits` is a no-brainer plain text file contains a load of horseshits that may distract you from work, line by line.

    plus.google.com
    twitter.com
    reader.google.com
    reddit.com

Also there is an example of what `horseshits` should be like in: `horseshits.example`.

On *nix systems, put your `horseshits` into:

    /etc/horseshits

You can simply use the example I provided if you'd like:

    sudo cp horseshits.example /etc/horseshits

Or start writing your own:

    sudo vi /etc/horseshits

On Windows, put it into your own user directory:

    .config/horseshits

### 2. To get-shit-done

Execute `get-shit-done` as root because it modifies your hosts file and restarts your network daemon.

    $ sudo get-shit-done work

### 3. To no longer get-shit-done

    $ sudo get-shit-done play



## Additional Tips

You can, of course, use `get-shit-done` with your `crontab`, to control your work time and play time during the day. Whatever, I should say self-control is always the best.



## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Vic Cherubini, the original author of __get-shit-done__.

Thanks to myself. It finally comes to me that I have to stop my goddamned procrastination and increase focus NOW - for a proper work efficiency.

Shit kickin' productivity!
