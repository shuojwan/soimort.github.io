据说做[Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam)的程序员大体上可以分为三种。

## 问题描述

### 2013 Qualification Round - Problem A

__Problem__

Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek is a game played on a 4 x 4 square board. The board starts empty, except that a single 'T' symbol may appear in one of the 16 squares. There are two players: X and O. They take turns to make moves, with X starting. In each move a player puts her symbol in one of the empty squares. Player X's symbol is 'X', and player O's symbol is 'O'.

After a player's move, if there is a row, column or a diagonal containing 4 of that player's symbols, or containing 3 of her symbols and the 'T' symbol, she wins and the game ends. Otherwise the game continues with the other player's move. If all of the fields are filled with symbols and nobody won, the game ends in a draw. See the sample input for examples of various winning positions.

Given a 4 x 4 board description containing 'X', 'O', 'T' and '.' characters (where '.' represents an empty square), describing the current state of a game, determine the status of the Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek game going on. The statuses to choose from are:

* "X won" (the game is over, and X won)
* "O won" (the game is over, and O won)
* "Draw" (the game is over, and it ended in a draw)
* "Game has not completed" (the game is not over yet)

If there are empty cells, and the game is not over, you should output "Game has not completed", even if the outcome of the game is inevitable.

__Input__

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, __T__. __T__ test cases follow. Each test case consists of 4 lines with 4 characters each, with each character being 'X', 'O', '.' or 'T' (quotes for clarity only). Each test case is followed by an empty line.

__Output__

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is one of the statuses given above. Make sure to get the statuses exactly right. When you run your code on the sample input, it should create the sample output exactly, including the "Case #1: ", the capital letter "O" rather than the number "0", and so on.

__Limits__

The game board provided will represent a valid state that was reached through play of the game Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek as described above.

__Small dataset__

1 ≤ __T__ ≤ 10.

__Large dataset__

1 ≤ __T__ ≤ 1000.

__Sample__

Input:

    6
    XXXT
    ....
    OO..
    ....

    XOXT
    XXOO
    OXOX
    XXOO

    XOX.
    OX..
    ....
    ....

    OOXX
    OXXX
    OX.T
    O..O

    XXXO
    ..O.
    .O..
    T...

    OXXX
    XO..
    ..O.
    ...O

Output:

    Case #1: X won
    Case #2: Draw
    Case #3: Game has not completed
    Case #4: O won
    Case #5: O won
    Case #6: O won

## 普通

[普通程序员用Python](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/13/lang/Python)，过程式地依次检查每一行、每一列和每一对角线的数组值（并借助于临时的计数器变量），来确定当前棋局的状态：

## 文艺

[文艺程序员用Haskell](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/13/lang/Haskell)，通过纯函数直接检查棋盘的状态，无须任何变量：

## 2B

[2B程序员](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/13/name/soimort)会去尝试枚举每一种可能的情形，进行逐个匹配，然后[随便找一种](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)理论上图灵完备的[Turing tarpit](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit)语言来实现具体的算法：
